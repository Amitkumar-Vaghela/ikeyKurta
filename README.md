36 leetcode solution in java

The problem titled "Valid Sudoku" (LeetCode Problem 36) asks you to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. A Sudoku board is valid if:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Here is a Java solution for the problem:

java
Copy code
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        // Use arrays to keep track of occurrences of numbers in rows, columns, and boxes.
        boolean[][] rows = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][] cols = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][] boxes = new boolean[9][9];

        // Iterate through each cell in the 9x9 grid.
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue; // Skip empty cells.

                int num = board[i][j] - '1'; // Map '1'-'9' to indices 0-8.

                int boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3); // Calculate which box the current cell is in.

                // Check if the number has already been seen in the current row, column, or box.
                if (rows[i][num] || cols[j][num] || boxes[boxIndex][num]) {
                    return false;
                }

                // Mark the number as seen in the current row, column, and box.
                rows[i][num] = true;
                cols[j][num] = true;
                boxes[boxIndex][num] = true;
            }
        }

        return true; // If no conflicts were found, the board is valid.
    }
}
Explanation:
Tracking Occurrences: We use three boolean 2D arrays (rows, cols, and boxes) to keep track of the digits that have already appeared in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box.
Mapping Characters to Indices: Since the board contains characters '1' to '9', we subtract '1' to convert them into indices 0 to 8.
Box Index Calculation: The index for the 3x3 sub-box is calculated by combining the row and column indices.
Validation: For each cell, we check if the current number has already appeared in the same row, column, or sub-box. If it has, the board is invalid.
Returning the Result: If no duplicate is found in the checks, the board is valid.
This solution runs in O(1) space (apart from the input board) and checks each of the 81 cells in constant time, making it very efficient.

The error you're seeing typically occurs when there is a misplaced or extra closing bracket (}) or if the code isn't properly encapsulated within a class or method. Here's the corrected structure of the Java code, ensuring it is within a class:

java
Copy code
public class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        // Use arrays to keep track of occurrences of numbers in rows, columns, and boxes.
        boolean[][] rows = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][] cols = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][] boxes = new boolean[9][9];

        // Iterate through each cell in the 9x9 grid.
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue; // Skip empty cells.

                int num = board[i][j] - '1'; // Map '1'-'9' to indices 0-8.

                int boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3); // Calculate which box the current cell is in.

                // Check if the number has already been seen in the current row, column, or box.
                if (rows[i][num] || cols[j][num] || boxes[boxIndex][num]) {
                    return false;
                }

                // Mark the number as seen in the current row, column, and box.
                rows[i][num] = true;
                cols[j][num] = true;
                boxes[boxIndex][num] = true;
            }
        }

        return true; // If no conflicts were found, the board is valid.
    }
}
Points to check:
Encapsulation: Ensure that the isValidSudoku method is inside a public class Solution.
Bracket Matching: Make sure every opening { has a corresponding closing }.
This code is now correctly structured for a typical Java class, and should compile and run without the class, interface, enum, or record expected error.
